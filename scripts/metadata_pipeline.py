"""Build the contents of metadata/ - composition statistics and external ids.

Generative AI assistance
------------------------
This script was written with the assistance of generative AI (Claude, by
Anthropic) in September 2026, adapted from the scripts in the fork of this
repository made by Stefan Balke (https://github.com/stefan-balke/mpb-corpus).
The design decisions recorded in the comments below were measured against the
live services, not assumed.

What it produces
----------------
One row per composition in metadata/compositions.csv, linking each of them to
the outside world:

    corpus_id, composition_id     identity, from dataset_by_corpus/
    composition_name              "
    has_note_function             whether note-function data exists for it
    spotify_*                     the matched recording on Spotify
    isrc                          the recording's ISO 3901 identifier
    musicbrainz_*                 recording and work ids, and how certain

Commands
--------
build    refresh composition identity and has_note_function from
         dataset_by_corpus/, leaving every external identifier alone
spotify  fetch every corpus playlist named in corpora.csv, match each
         composition to a track by title, and fold the result in  (network)
isrc     fetch each matched track's ISRC from the Spotify Web API
         (network; the only command needing credentials)
mbisrc   look up MusicBrainz recording and work ids by ISRC - a direct
         lookup, nothing scored                                   (network)

Usage
-----
Run from the repository root - the directory holding dataset_by_corpus/::

    python scripts/metadata_pipeline.py build
    python scripts/metadata_pipeline.py spotify
    python scripts/metadata_pipeline.py isrc
    python scripts/metadata_pipeline.py mbisrc

That is also the order they depend on each other in: 'spotify' needs the rows
'build' writes, 'isrc' needs the track ids 'spotify' finds, and 'mbisrc' needs
the codes 'isrc' fetches. Each refuses to run if its input is missing.

'isrc' needs a Spotify app registered at
https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard, and reads its credentials from the
environment - never from a file::

    PowerShell  $env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='...'; $env:SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
    bash        export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=... SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=...

'mbisrc' is rate limited and resumable: it caches every answer, so an
interrupted run continues where it stopped rather than repeating hundreds of
requests.

How to read the results
-----------------------
None of the external identifiers has been reviewed by a human. The Spotify
match compares titles only, so it can pick the wrong recording, release or
version of the right composition - and a 'fuzzy' or 'normalized' status says
the title did not even match exactly.

The MusicBrainz columns are more careful, and say how certain they are rather
than only what they found. An id is written only where the answer is
unambiguous; where it is not, the count says how many candidates exist. See
cmd_mbisrc.

Everything here is generated except corpora.csv, which is hand-authored. Edits
made by hand to any other file are destroyed by the next run.

Standard library only, on purpose: this must still run years from now, when a
pinned scientific stack no longer resolves.

#   - all 29 ISRCs were known to MusicBrainz;
#   - all 20 previously 'confirmed' rows returned the same recording id, so the

#   - all 9 'contradicted' rows returned several recordings each (up to 7) that
#     collapse to exactly ONE work. Those were never competing performances,
#     but duplicate recording entries for one composition.
# Hence recordings and works are both recorded, and an id is written only when
